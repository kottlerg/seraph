# programs

General-purpose userspace applications and utilities. These are
applications, not services — they have no special privileges beyond
what their capabilities grant. They interact with the system through
the IPC interfaces exposed by vfs, net, and other services.

| `pipestress` | Spawn-exit-drain stress fixture for the pipe EOF-drain regression test. |
| `shell` | Minimal interactive shell; the child of `terminal`. |
