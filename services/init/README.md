# init

Bootstrap service and first userspace process. The kernel starts init at the end
of its initialization sequence. Init runs a three-stage bootstrap — raw memmgr /
procmgr creation, root acquisition, then handover to svcmgr — and exits. It is
not a long-lived service manager.

```

Init depends on `shared/elf` for ELF parsing (used to load memmgr and procmgr
from their bundle entries) and `shared/syscall` for raw syscall wrappers (used
to create memmgr and procmgr without IPC).

## Bootstrap

Init runs three stages between `_start` and `sys_thread_exit`:

1. **Raw bootstrap** — version-check `InitInfo`, set up the IPC buffer, mint
   endpoints, spawn init-logd, bring up memmgr and procmgr via raw syscalls,
   then drive procmgr IPC to create devmgr and vfsd.
2. **Root acquisition** — vfsd self-mounts the Seraph root partition at `/`
   on its own startup; init issues no `MOUNT`. Pull the seed
   `system_root_cap` via `GET_SYSTEM_ROOT_CAP` (which vfsd serves only once
   root is mounted, so the call blocks until root is up), then launch
   real-logd from `/services/logd` and hand off the master log endpoint via
   `HANDOVER_PULL`.
3. **Handover** — load svcmgr and serve it the handover endowment over
   the bootstrap-round protocol: its own endpoints, the publish-role
   source caps (`rootfs.root` SEND, devmgr-registry `SEND|GRANT` source),
   and one `(name, thread_cap)` round per init-bootstrapped substrate
   service. Signal `HANDOVER_COMPLETE`; hand init's own kernel objects +
   reclaimable Frame caps to procmgr via `REGISTER_INIT_TEARDOWN`; call
   `sys_thread_exit`. Procmgr's death-EQ observer then runs the reap path.
   svcmgr publishes the well-known names it now owns (`rootfs.root`,
   `svcmgr`, `devmgr.registry`) and installs devmgr's `/services/drivers/`
   cap via `SET_DRIVERS_DIR` from the endowment; it then launches the
   non-bootstrap services itself — `timed` and `pwrmgr` (providers), the
   staged test harnesses — and publishes their names. The per-arch RTC
   chip driver is devmgr-spawned lazily after `SET_DRIVERS_DIR` and
   resolved by timed via `QUERY_RTC_DEVICE`.

See [docs/bootstrap.md](docs/bootstrap.md) for the authoritative
stage-by-stage enumeration, source citations, and per-stage capability
transfer table.

## What init does NOT do

- Does not supervise services or restart them on crash (svcmgr's
  responsibility).
- Does not retain raw process-creation capabilities — the kernel-object
  retypes (`cap_create_aspace` / `cap_create_cspace` / `cap_create_thread`)
  used to bring up memmgr and procmgr happen only in init's Raw bootstrap
  stage; after that, every process is created via procmgr IPC.
- Does not read a service dependency graph file at runtime (bootstrap order
  is compiled in).
- Does not remain resident after bootstrap completes — procmgr reaps init's
  address space, CSpace, and threads after `sys_thread_exit`.
